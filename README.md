# CV_Dashboard

Main objective is to *create a dashboard that shows, not only my tableau skills, but also my curriculum vitae in an engaging and interactive way*

Tasks I needed to do in order to complete the project
`- Create a text, divided in sections (Language, Skills, Education and Work Experience) reflecting on my trajectory since I started in the workplace`
`- Using the data created (texts) organize it in some spreadsheets`

`Those tables were made with the objective of transforming them into a comprehensible dashboard that presents key information to employers about me in an accessible and interactive way.` 
`I used this model to do the calculations of experience in percentages (%) that you see in in the collumn entitled: proficency, but I ended up deciding to not use this measurement in my final work because it clouds the measurement. Instead I used, simply, the duration in years (continuous data) to measure my experience in skills. However, in the language section I verified percentages are a better fit for expressing proficiency because they emphasize current ability over just time spent learning.`
